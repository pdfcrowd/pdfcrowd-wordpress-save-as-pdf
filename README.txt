Let your visitors save pages as PDF in a single click. Reliable, fast and highly customizable.

== Description ==

The Save as PDF plugin is easy to use. Just install the plugin and activate it. The plugin puts a "Save as PDF" button in your web pages. The button enables to save the current web page (the default), or only a part of the page or an arbitrary page in one click.

The plugin internally uses the Pdfcrowd API web service. The Pdfcrowd API is a professional solution for converting web pages and HTML documents to PDF and various image formats.


The plugin is highly customizable, you can:
* customize the button style, text and icon
* choose between the "screen" and "print" layout (CSS @media)
* convert password-protected pages
* convert pages with data in forms
* create interactive PDF forms
* customize page size and margins, page orientation, header and footer, run custom JavaScript, add a watermark, and many more ...

You can customize the plugin on the Settings page.


**Shortcodes**

The **[save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd]** shortcode places a button in the web page. Clicking the button downloads the page as PDF.

The enclosing **[block_save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd]** shortcode downloads just the enclosed part of the page as PDF. To style the part, include CSS rules inside the block shortcode.

The shortcodes can customize the button style and conversion output by overriding the settings specified on the plugin Settings page.

For example, to change the page size to Letter and create a red button use:

`[save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd page_size='letter' button_background_color='red']`


**Create Button in PHP**

The conversion button can be created directly in your PHP code with the **create_save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd_button**($options = array()) function.

`<?php

create_save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd_button(array(
    'page_size' => 'letter',
    'button_text' => 'Save as Letter'));

?>`


**Button CSS Customization**

The button style can be customized also by setting CSS properties on the save-as-pdf-pdfcrowd-button-wrap or save-as-pdf-pdfcrowd-button classes.

`.save-as-pdf-pdfcrowd-button {
    font-family: Georgia;
}`


**Output**

The output PDF can be either downloaded or opened directly in the browser. This can be configured with the "Button Click Action" option.

The output file name is generated automatically or can be specified in custom options, e.g.

`[save_as_pdf_pdfcrowd output_name='my-page.pdf' button_background_color='red']`


**Support**

Please contact us on support@pdfcrowd.com us if you need any help.
We recommend that you check our [FAQ](https://pdfcrowd.com/faq/). It contains answers to many common questions.

Pdfcrowd [API Playground](https://pdfcrowd.com/playground/) may help you to configure the plugin, create a [shortcode](https://pdfcrowd.com/playground/html-to-pdf/?lang=wf-wpscode) or a [function call](https://pdfcrowd.com/playground/html-to-pdf/?lang=wf-wpfunc).

== Installation ==

1. Go to your WordPress backend, search for "Save as PDF by Pdfcrowd" and then click "Install". Or you can download the save-as-pdf-pdfcrowd.zip file and unzip it.
2. If you downloaded the zip, upload the save-as-pdf-pdfcrowd folder into wp-content/plugins folder.
3. Activate the plugin.

== Licensing ==

The plugin runs in the demo by default. It is fully functional but adds a watermark and Pdfcrowd branding over the content.

You can purchase a Pdfcrowd [API license](https://pdfcrowd.com/user/account/api2-license/?ref=wordpress) to remove the demo watermark and Pdfcrowd branding. To activate the license, enter your Pdfcrowd username and your API key in the plugin settings on the Basics tab.

A single Pdfcrowd API license can be used for both our plugins on multiple WordPress websites. Moreover, the API license enables you to use the [Pdfcrowd conversion API](https://pdfcrowd.com/api/) directly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I convert password-protected pages? =

Yes, set "Conversion Mode" to "upload", "content" or "development" on the Settings|Behavior page or enable HTTP Basic Authentication for your site or choose other methods for accessing your pages (Client Certificate, Custom Cookies, Custom HTTP Headers).

= Can I convert my localhost or dynamic pages? =

Yes, set "Conversion Mode" to "upload", "content" or "development" on the Settings|Behavior page.

= Can I convert data entered into a form? =

Yes, set "Conversion Mode" to "content" on the Settings|Behavior page.

= Are my data safe? =

Yes, Pdfcrowd is GDPR compliant. All data for the conversion are kept only for the time necessary to efficiently process the conversion and then permanently deleted.

= My page is not printed correctly. What should I do? =

The first thing to try is to play with the following configuration settings: "Conversion Mode", "Viewport Width", "Wiewport Height", "Rendering Mode" and "Smart Scaling Mode". If it does not help, contact us at support@pdfcrowd.com.

= How to exclude some parts of a web page? =

Add "pdfcrowd-remove" or "pdfcrowd-hide" CSS class to the HTML elements you want to remove or hide. Another option is to remove them using custom Javascript code set in the "Custom Javascript" option.

= How to print HTML form with user data? =

Use Conversion Mode - Content. If the data is still missing, it is probably reset by some caching mechanism on your site. Try disabling the cache for the page or check Disable JavaScript option on the plugin General Options tab.

= Can you help me? =

Yes, Pdfcrowd support (support@pdfcrowd.com) is more than happy to help you with any issue you may have.
